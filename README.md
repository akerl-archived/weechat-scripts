My Weechat scripts

## Scripts

### regex_hilight

This is designed to let Weechat do smarter hilighting, using multiple regexes on a per-channel basis

It is controlled via `/regex`, and stores your hilight configuration in its own file.

### squelch_away

Unlike irssi, Weechat shows every away message it receives from other users. This gets really annoying if you're sending multiple messages to someone. This is going to filter out repeated messages using some kind of timer. Right now it doesn't work.
